# Sentiment

Now we care about what the actual meaning of the words and sentences. In this example we have some data regarding positive comments and negative comments that you can check out in the `corpus` directory. Based on these data, we want our AI to identify if some comments are positive or negative

## How to Use

In the `sentiment` directory, run the command `python sentiment.py corpus`

You will be prompt to enter a comment, and the AI will calculate the probability that your comment is positive or negative
