# Hidden Markov Chain

The AI uses its observations about the world to deduce facts. In this example, the AI will observe whether people bring umbrella or not to predict whether today is rainy or sunny, and generate a Markov Chain

- `model.py`: Defines probabilities and the Markov Chain model
- `sequence.py`: Using some observations about the world, the AI will predict a sequence of facts

## How to Use

In `hmm` directory, run the command `python sequence.py`
